Make sure you have Docker installed on your computer. If you donâ€™t have it yet, you can download it from this link: 
https://www.docker.com. open the application then proceed to the steps. 

1. Open the terminal, navigate to the backend directory, and run the following command:
"composer install" - delete composer.lock if error persist then "composer install --no-scripts"

Create a .env file on backend directory and copy the content from .env.example to the newly created .env file.

The PHP version used is 8.1. You can change it in the Dockerfile to match the PHP version you are using.

"docker compose up -d" this is to run the backend thru docker compose.
close then open your code editor to apply the changes if error persist

Before proceeding to the next step, make sure to run the migration to set up the customer table then proceed to run the following command: 
"docker compose exec app php artisan migrate"

2. To run the react frontend, go to client-side folder install the necessary npm packages by running the following command: 
"npm install"

    Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser at: "http://localhost:3000/"


    To test it in a local environment, follow these steps to configure your database settings:
